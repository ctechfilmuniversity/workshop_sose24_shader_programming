What do we need from shapes
in Computer Graphics?
* Local control of shape for modeling
* Ability to model what we need
* Smoothness and continuity
* Ability to evaluate derivatives
* Ability to do collision detection
* Ease of rendering
No single technique solves all problems!

## Geometry

A rough analogy is to the different surface representations is to think about vector vs. raster graphics:

These are different representations for graphics with individual strengths and weaknesses.

.task[COMMENT:]  

Polygon Meshes  
• Any shape can be modeled out of  
polygons  
    – if you use enough of them…  
• Polygons with how many sides?  
    – Can use triangles, quadrilaterals,  
pentagons, … n-gons  
    – Triangles are most common.  
    – When > 3 sides are used, ambiguity about what to do  
when polygon nonplanar, or concave, or self-  
intersecting.  
• Polygon meshes are built out of  
    – vertices (points)  
    – edges (line segments between vertices)  
    – faces (polygons bounded by edges)  
  
Data Structures for Polygon Meshes  
• Simplest (but dumb)  
    – float triangle[n][3][3]; (each triangle stores 3 (x,y,z) points)  
    – redundant: each vertex stored multiple times  
• Vertex List, Face List  
    – List of vertices, each vertex consists of (x,y,z) geometric (shape)  
info only  
    – List of triangles, each a triple of vertex id’s (or pointers) topological  
(connectivity, adjacency) info only  
Fine for many purposes, but finding the faces adjacent to a vertex  
takes O(F) time for a model with F faces. Such queries are  
important for topological editing.  
• Fancier schemes:  
Store more topological info so adjacency queries can be answered in  
O(1) time.  
Winged-edge data structure – edge structures contain all topological  
info (pointers to adjacent vertices, edges, and faces).

* How to find a point on the surface of the sphere?
* All an implicit representation says is that points that actually lie on the surface of the sphere, in other words all points making up the surface of the sphere or its isosurface, satisfy this equation.
* The formula results in 0 for a given point, if it is on the surface. 
* (Hence, for *implicit* surfaces the actual surface is not directly defined.)

* Instead of finding a simple union or intersection, you can compute what is called a [smooth minimum](https://www.iquilezles.org/www/articles/smin/smin.htm). Essentially this allows you to take the union of two objects, and smooth out the intersection point. This allows shapes to blend together as they get near each other.
